"""
stl2curves - convert STL mesh files into solid STEP files for Fusion / any CAD.

What it does:
  1. Reads the STL triangles and groups them into flat facets.
  2. Finds curved areas and works out the exact surface each lies on: holes, pins,
     rounded edges (fillets), chamfers/countersinks around round edges, cones,
     domes, dimples, balls and rounded corners.
  3. Builds a real solid from exact faces: one flat face per flat region (a box
     wall is one face you can select, offset, sketch on, press/pull...) and one
     true curved face per curved area, so Fusion sees real circular edges you can
     select, measure, dimension and fillet.
  4. Writes a .step file next to the STL (or into --out folder).

Straight chamfers and flat faces are exact already. Curved areas that don't match
one of the recognised shapes cleanly (freeform surfaces, variable-radius blends,
odd corner blends) stay as small flat facets.

Usage:
  stl2curves file1.stl [file2.stl ...] [--out FOLDER] [--merge NAME]
  stl2curves some_folder            (converts every .stl and .3mf in it)

  (or "python -m stl2curves ..." when it isn't installed as a command)

  --merge NAME     also write all inputs together into one NAME.step
  --tol X          sewing tolerance in mm (default 0.01)
  --no-fuse        keep overlapping bodies within one STL as separate bodies
  --no-curves      skip curve detection (leave everything faceted)
  --true-size      rebuild at the size the part appears to have been designed at
                   (undoing e.g. a 99% slicer scale or an inch/cm export), with radii
                   snapped to round values
  --details        list every rebuilt feature with its size
  --simplify MM    thin out an over-dense mesh first, moving its surface by at most MM
                   (0: never; by default meshes over 150,000 triangles, at 0.005 mm)
  --no-repair      don't mend mesh defects first
