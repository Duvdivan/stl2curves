"""
Fillets between flat faces, and between a flat face and a curved wall, found the way a
designer sees them.

Two flat faces that would meet at a sharp edge, rounded off with a fillet: the fillet
is a cylinder touching both faces (a ball of the fillet radius rolled along the
edge). Its axis runs parallel to the edge where the faces would meet, so given the two
faces the only unknown is the radius, and every mesh corner on the rounded band
between them pins it down. (Constant-radius "rolling ball" blend recovery between
primary surfaces, as in reverse-engineering work by Várady, Benkő, Kós and Martin.)

Everything happens in a cross-section, where the ball is a circle rolling between two
curves (a configuration: _Lines, _LineCircle), and each band corner gives the radius
of the circle through it touching both, from a quadratic:

- two flat faces: two lines, seen across their edge; the fillet is a cylinder.
- a flat face square to the axis of a cone or cylinder found already (a floor round a
  boss or hole): two lines in the half plane through the axis; the fillet is a torus.
- a flat face beside a cylinder whose axis runs along it (a boss standing out of a
  wall, a groove cut into a face): a line and a circle, seen along the axis; the
  fillet is a cylinder. (|o - c| = R +- r and |o - q| = r, for the ball's centre o
  at height r off the line, differ by an equation linear in o and r.)

Fillets are everywhere in printed parts, and a mesh often keeps too little accuracy to
show them cleanly, so this is forgiving where the general surface passes can't be:

- The whole band between the two faces is collected first (facets turning steadily
  from one face's normal to the other's, lying between the faces), and the radius is
  the one most of its corners agree on, so a few stray corners don't spoil it.
- A band whose corners stay within FILLET_TOL of that fillet is taken: looser than the
  mesh's own tolerance, since the faces either side pin the surface down. The faces
  must run along the whole band (a narrow strip of a curved wall is no face for a
  rounded edge that follows the curve).
- One fillet radius is usually used all over a design. Bands that miss on their own are
  tried again with each radius found with confidence elsewhere in the part held fixed
  (a 4.99 or 4.9 mm look-alike next to clean 5 mm fillets is a 5 mm fillet), within
  PRIOR_TOL.

It runs before the passes that propose surfaces from pairs of neighbouring facets,
which would otherwise cut a coarsely meshed fillet into narrow strips of their own.
Finely cut pins aren't mistaken for fillets: the faces a fillet joins must be clearly
bigger than the facets of its band.
